# quasarr/downloads/linkcrypters/ - Crypter Decryption

## Purpose

Self-contained decryption logic for link-crypter containers, with two distinct consumers: the download orchestrator (auto-decrypt) and the AL source. Protected crypters (filecrypt, keeplinks, tolink, junkies) have no decryption code here - they are solved in the user's browser via the `/captcha` userscript flow.

## Ownership

- `hide.py` - the only crypter auto-decrypted inside `process_links` (no CAPTCHA): resolves redirects, decrypts containers via the crypter's JSON API in thread batches, resolves `/fc/` "foreign" filecrypt-twin IDs to canonical container IDs. Returns `{"status": "success"|"none"|"error", "results": [urls]}`.
- `al.py` - AL-source-only helpers: CNL AES-CBC decrypt (jk hex chars 15/16 swapped), mirror-filtered `decrypt_content`, and a pixel-difference image-captcha solver (requires FlareSolverr). AL binds a solved CAPTCHA to the `requests.Session` that solved it: FlareSolverr only arms the challenge (the `nocaptcha` `/ajax/captcha` request), while the icon fetch + selection submit (`/files/captcha`) and the final `/ajax/captcha` validation must run on that same session - validating from the FlareSolverr browser instead is rejected with `The captcha ID was invalid`.

## Local Contracts

- Callers depend on the exact return shapes above; changing them means updating `downloads/__init__.py` (hide) in the same change.
- Crypter brand hostnames committed in this folder (the hide family) are the accepted exception to the no-hostname rule - they are link-crypter services, not sources. Never add source hostnames here.

## Work Guidance

- Keep crypter-detection substrings in sync with `constants.AUTO_DECRYPT_PATTERNS`/`PROTECTED_PATTERNS` and the routing in `api/captcha`.

## Verification

- Full suite: `uv run python -X utf8 -m unittest discover -s tests`

## Child DOX Index
