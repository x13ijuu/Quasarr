# Flow (IMDb-driven):
#   1. IMDb ID -> localized title via category-bound get_localized_title(..., "fr")
#   2. search the title endpoint -> candidate entries (carry imdb_id + id)
#   3. match the entry whose imdb_id equals the requested IMDb ID
#   4. the download endpoint -> per-quality hoster links for that entry
#   5. the decode endpoint -> the real hoster URL
#
# The API returns the matching tmdb_id in its own search response and the
# download endpoint keys on the internal id alone, so no external
# TMDB/Radarr/Sonarr resolution is needed for searches. The feed has no native
# discovery endpoint, so it seeds from the *arr libraries.

# One pooled session for every MX request. The crawler fires hundreds of API
# calls per feed run (search + download + one decode per link, times up to 50
# seeds); with bare requests.get() each of them resolved DNS and opened a fresh
# TLS connection — measured 2026-08-16 as ~700 DNS queries/min on the API host,
# enough to trip AdGuard's per-subnet rate limit and degrade DNS for every
# container on the box. Keep-alive turns a crawl into a handful of connections
# (and DNS lookups) instead. Sources are process-wide singletons, so this
# session lives exactly as long as the crawler does; urllib3's pool is
